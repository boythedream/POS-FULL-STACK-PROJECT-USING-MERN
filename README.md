- **Customer Management**: Store and view customer details.
- **Sales Tracking**: Track sales and calculate taxes and totals.
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly and responsive UI.
- **Authentication**: Secure login system for users.
- **Detailed Invoice View**: Modal view for detailed invoice information.
- **Data Persistence**: MongoDB for data storage.

## Tech Stack

- **Icons**: Ant Design Icons
- **HTTP Client**: Axios

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- MongoDB installed and running.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone  https://github.com/boythedream/POS-FULL-STACK-PROJECT-USING-MERN.git
    cd pos-mern-stack
    ```

2. Install dependencies for the client and server:

    ```bash
    # In the root directory
    npm install
    ```

3. Navigate to the `client` folder and install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

    ```env
    MONGO_URI=your_mongo_db_connection_string
    PORT=8080
    ```

5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    # In the root directory, start the server
    npm run dev

    # In the client directory, start the React app
    cd client
